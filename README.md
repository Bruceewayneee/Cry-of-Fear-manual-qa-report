# 🎮 Cry of Fear – Manual Game Testing Report

This repository contains a manual QA test report for the psychological horror game **Cry of Fear**, developed using the legacy Half-Life (GoldSrc) engine and available for free on Steam.

## 🧪 Purpose

The purpose of this report is to improve my skills in game quality assurance and bug reporting through hands-on testing. All findings are based on my own gameplay experience and analysis. I aim to observe, document, and reflect on common issues and user experience challenges in games — particularly indie and legacy-engine titles — as part of my QA development journey.

## 📈 Community Feedback

This project is part of an ongoing QA initiative that I started 3 weeks ago.  
Across all my public test reports, I’ve received:

- **1000+ total views**
- **100+ total clones**
- **100+ unique visitors actively downloading and reviewing reports**

This growing interest motivates me to continue improving and sharing insights for both developers and the QA community.

## 📌 Scope
